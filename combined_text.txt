# Context-Engine Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Cache Bypass Protocol**: Implemented "Stealth Mode" for browser AI engine by overriding Cache API and modifying static file headers to force browser to treat models as "data in RAM" rather than "persistent storage", bypassing strict security policies.
- **NoCacheStaticFiles**: Custom StaticFiles class with `Cache-Control: no-store` headers to prevent browser cache API usage when serving models through the bridge.
- **Neural Shell Protocol**: Activated "The Hands" (Layer 3) in `webgpu_bridge.py` (`/v1/shell/exec`), allowing the browser to execute system commands on the host.
- **Neural Terminal**: `tools/neural-terminal.html` provides a matrix-style command interface for direct shell access from the browser.
- **Hot Reload Improvement**: Fixed `start-sovereign-console-hotreload.bat` port conflicts and added `/file-mod-time` endpoint to `smart_gpu_bridge.py` for correct frontend reloading.
- **Root Mic (Audio Input)**: Renamed `sovereign-mic.html` to `root-mic.html` and added "Summarize & Clarify" feature using the local Qwen2.5 model.
- **Long-Form Transcription**: Fixed Whisper pipeline to support recordings >30s using chunking and striding.
- **CozoDB Corruption Recovery**: Enhanced error handling for IndexedDB corruption with automatic fallback to in-memory database, manual recovery button, and timeout protection against hanging WASM calls.
- **Bulk CozoDB Import Tool**: Added `tools/prepare_cozo_import.py` to transform `combined_memory.json` into the canonical `relations` payload (`cozo_import_memory.json`) for atomic bulk imports into CozoDB.
- **Import Safety & Verification**: Added recommended import procedure and a post-import verification + backup step to avoid Schema Detachment.
- **WebGPU Bridge**: `webgpu_bridge.py` for proxying OpenAI API requests to browser workers.
- **Chat Worker**: `webgpu-server-chat.html` for running LLMs in the browser.
- **Embed Worker**: `webgpu-server-embed.html` for running embedding models in the browser.
- **Mobile Chat**: `mobile-chat.html` for a lightweight, mobile-friendly UI.
- **Log Viewer**: `log-viewer.html` for real-time server log monitoring.

### Changed
- **Model Loading**: Updated `model-server-chat.html` to use bridge-based model URLs (`http://localhost:8080/models/`) with comprehensive cache-disabling configuration to prevent Cache API errors.
- **Ingestion Defaults**: Recommended batch size increased to 100 to prevent long-running slow writes that can desync CozoDB's in-memory metadata.
- **Git Configuration**: Added `models/` directory to `.gitignore` to prevent committing large binary model files.

---

2.  **Open** `tools/index.html` in Chrome or Edge.
3.  **Click** "Double Click to Launch" on the Console.

*That's it. You are running a local LLM with persistent Graph Memory.*

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system runs entirely in `tools/` using WebAssembly (WASM).

### 1. The Sovereign Loop
```mermaid
graph TD
    User -->|Input| HTML[model-server-chat.html]

    subgraph Browser_Memory ["Two Birds, One Stone"]
        HTML -->|Store/Retrieve| Cozo["CozoDB WASM"]
        Cozo -->|Persist| IDB["IndexedDB/OPFS"]
    end

    subgraph Cognitive_Engine
        HTML -->|Context + Prompt| WebLLM["DeepSeek-R1 (WASM)"]
        WebLLM -->|Reasoning Trace| HTML
    end
```

### 2. Core Components
*   **Brain**: `model-server-chat.html` - Runs the Graph-R1 Reasoning Loop. Now uses **Hybrid Search** (Vector + Lexical) and supports SOTA models (Qwen 3, Gemma 3).
*   **Memory**: `CozoDB (WASM)` - Stores relations (`*memory`) and vectors. Persists to browser IndexedDB.
*   **Stomach**: `sovereign-db-builder.html` - Ingests files into the graph. Now "Multisensory-Ready" (Phase A): accepts images/audio as references.

## 🔥 Hot Reload System

The system includes a comprehensive hot reload mechanism for GPU management and development:

*   **Automatic Reload**: Changes to GPU-related files trigger automatic reloads
*   **Browser Integration**: Hot reload functionality built into all components
*   **No Service Restart**: Updates occur without restarting services
*   **Stale Lock Prevention**: Automatic cleanup during reloads
*   **Development Mode**: Automatically activates when running on localhost
*   **File Monitoring**: Monitors GPU-related files every 2 seconds for changes
*   **Enhanced Monitoring**: Includes GPU manager with status checking capabilities

### Getting Started with Hot Reload
1. Use the enhanced startup script: `start-sovereign-console-hotreload.bat`
2. Monitor changes in real-time with the GPU manager: `python scripts/gpu_manager.py`
3. Manual reload triggers available in browser console: `window.triggerGPUHotReload()`
4. Enable/disable hot reload in browser: `window.setGPUHotReloadEnabled(true/false)`
5. Manual trigger for hot reload: `python scripts/gpu_manager.py --hot-reload`

### Files Monitored
- `tools/webgpu_bridge.py` - Backend bridge logic
- `tools/modules/sovereign.js` - Frontend GPU controller
- `tools/model-server-chat.html` - Main console interface
- `tools/root-mic.html` - Voice input interface
- `tools/root-dreamer.html` - Background processing

### Benefits
- **Faster Development**: Changes take effect immediately
- **No Service Interruption**: Updates occur without restarting services
- **Stale Lock Prevention**: Automatic cleanup during reloads
- **Development Convenience**: Built-in triggers for manual reloads

## 🔄 Model Loading Serialization

The system now includes model loading serialization to prevent GPU overload:

*   **Sequential Loading**: Models load one at a time to prevent GPU resource contention
*   **Queue Management**: Proper queuing of model loading requests
*   **Resource Protection**: Prevents multiple models from loading simultaneously
*   **Improved Stability**: Reduces GPU memory allocation conflicts during startup
*   **Model URL Fixes**: Corrected model URLs to use reliable endpoints

    Launches the WebGPU Bridge with an ephemeral Firewall rule.
.DESCRIPTION
    1. Picks a random port (or uses -Port).

# Changelog

All notable changes to the `scripts/` module will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- **Smart GPU Bridge**: Added `StaticFiles` mount at `/models` to serve local model artifacts.
- **On-Demand Downloads**: Added `POST /v1/models/pull` and `GET /v1/models/pull/status` to handle server-side model downloading from Hugging Face.
- **Shared Module**: Integrated `scripts.download_models` for reusable download logic.

### Fixed
- **CORS/Auth Collision**: Reordered `CORSMiddleware` to wrap the entire application (including Auth middleware) to ensure CORS headers are sent even on 401 Unauthorized responses.
- **Authentication**: Exempted `/models` path from Token Verification to allow browser-side fetching of artifacts without credentials.
- **Import Error**: Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError` by changing import to `from download_models import ...` for direct script execution.

# Sovereign Architecture V2: The Ghost & The Shell

## 1. Overview
Architecture V2 decouples the **Interface** from the **Inference Engine**. 
Instead of a monolithic "Chat UI" inside a browser, the system splits into a background service (Ghost) and a lightweight client (Shell).

## 2. Component A: The Ghost (Headless Engine)
The Ghost is a background process responsible solely for loading the LLM into VRAM and exposing an API.

* **Current Implementation:** Headless Chromium (`launch-ghost.ps1`).
* **Future Implementation:** C++ Native Binary (`neural-ghost.exe`) using Dawn/WebGPU.
* **Responsibility:**
    * Manage WebGPU Context.
    * Load Weights (MLC-LLM).
    * Serve `localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions`.
    * **Stealth Mode:** Uses `NoCacheStaticFiles` to treat models as RAM-only data, bypassing browser storage quotas.

## 3. Component B: The Shell (Native Client)
The Shell is the user interface, residing in the user's native terminal environment (PowerShell, Bash, etc.).

* **Implementation:** Python Client (`tools/sov.py`).
* **Responsibility:**
    * Capture user input (`stdin`).
    * Send JSON payload to The Ghost.
    * Render streamed response to `stdout`.
    * Execute system commands (Agency).

## 4. The Data Flow
1.  **User:** Types `sov "List large files"` in PowerShell.
2.  **Shell:** Sends POST request to `localhost:8080`.
3.  **Bridge:** Forwards request to Headless Browser (Ghost) via Websocket/Fetch.
4.  **Ghost:** Runs inference on RTX 4090 via WebGPU.
5.  **Ghost:** Returns tokens -> Bridge -> Shell.
6.  **Shell:** Displays output or executes `Get-ChildItem` command.

## 5. Roadmap
- [x] **Phase 1:** "Stealth Mode" Cache Bypass (Completed).
- [x] **Phase 2:** Headless Browser Script (Completed).
- [x] **Phase 3:** `sov.py` Native Client Implementation.
- [x] **Phase 4:** Neural Shell Protocol (`/v1/shell/exec` endpoint).
- [x] **Phase 4.5:** Ghost Auto-Ignition (Auto-start with ?headless=true flag).
- [x] **Phase 5:** Native Shell Implementation (Anchor terminal with spawn endpoint).
- [ ] **Phase 6:** Migration to C++ Native Runtime (Removing Chrome entirely).

# Documentation Policy (Root Coda)

**Status:** Active | **Authority:** Human-Locked

## Core Philosophy
1. **Code is King:** Code is the only source of truth. Documentation is a map, not the territory.
2. **Visuals over Text:** Prefer Mermaid diagrams to paragraphs.
3. **Brevity:** Text sections must be <500 characters.

## Structure

### 1. The Blueprint (`specs/spec.md`)
*   **Role:** The single architectural source of truth.
*   **Format:** "Visual Monolith".
*   **Content:** High-level diagrams (Kernel, Memory, Logic, Bridge). No deep implementation details.

### 2. The Tracker (`specs/tasks.md`)
*   **Role:** Current work queue.
*   **Format:** Checklist.
*   **Maintenance:** Updated by Agents after every major task.

### 3. The Roadmap (`specs/plan.md`)
*   **Role:** Strategic vision.
*   **Format:** Phased goals.

### 4. Local Context (`*/README.md`)
*   **Role:** Directory-specific context.
*   **Limit:** 1 sentence explaining the folder's purpose.

## LLM Protocol
1. **Read-First:** Always read `specs/spec.md` before answering architectural questions.
2. **Drafting:** When asked to document, produce **Mermaid diagrams** and short summaries.
3. **Editing:** Do not modify `specs/doc_policy.md` or `specs/spec.md` structure unless explicitly instructed.
4. **Archival:** Move stale docs to `archive/` immediately.

# Verified MLC-LLM Model URLs

**Status:** Registry of verified WebLLM-compatible model URLs.
**Last Updated:** Dec 22, 2025
**Source:** `mlc-ai/web-llm` config and verified HTTP checks.

## Technology: WASM + WebGPU Inference

This project uses **WebLLM** (by MLC-AI) to run Large Language Models directly in the browser.

1.  **Compilation:** Models (Llama 3, Qwen 2.5, etc.) are compiled into **WebAssembly (WASM)** modules (`.wasm`). These modules contain the model's architecture and logic, optimized for execution in a web environment.
2.  **Acceleration:** The WASM module uses the **WebGPU API** to access the user's local GPU. This allows for massive parallelism, enabling 7B+ parameter models to run at interactive speeds (20-100+ tokens/sec) on consumer hardware.
3.  **Zero-Server:** No data leaves the browser. The "Backend" is the user's own GPU.

## Official Model Registry

**CRITICAL REFERENCE:** The definitive list of supported models and their WASM binaries can be found at:
- https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm/blob/main/src/config.ts#L293
- This contains the official `prebuiltAppConfig` with verified model configurations

**ADDITIONAL VERIFIED LINKS:**
- https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm/blob/main/src/config.ts#L293 - Contains verified MLC model configurations and working WASM URLs

---

## 1. Verified Models (Ready for Production)

These models have been verified to exist in the `v0_2_80` library and are compatible with the current `web-llm` version.

## 3. URL Construction Logic

If you need to construct a URL manually:

```javascript
const libBase = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlc-ai/binary-mlc-llm-libs/main/web-llm-models/";
const version = "v0_2_80"; // Check src/config.ts for 'modelVersion'
const modelSpecificName = "Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-q4f16_1-ctx4k_cs1k-webgpu.wasm";

const fullUrl = `${libBase}${version}/${modelSpecificName}`;
```

**Note:** The `modelSpecificName` often differs slightly from the Hugging Face repo name (e.g., `Llama-3_1` vs `Llama-3.1` or `Qwen2` base for `DeepSeek`). Always check `mlc_config.ts` mapping.

# Root Coda: The Visual Monolith (v2.1)

**Status:** Production | **Philosophy:** 100% Local, 100% Browser, 100% Sovereign.

## 1. The Kernel (System Architecture)
The **Sovereign Kernel** (`sovereign.js`) abstracts hardware, manages state, and enforces the "Consciousness Semaphore" (Resource Hardening).

```mermaid
graph TD
    User[User Input] --> Kernel[Sovereign Kernel]
    Kernel -->|State: LISTENING| Mic[Root Mic]
    Kernel -->|State: COGNITION| Console[Root Console]
    Kernel -->|State: DREAMING| Dreamer[Root Dreamer]
    
    subgraph Hardware Layer
        Kernel -->|Clamp Buffer| WebGPU[WebGPU Adapter]
        Kernel -->|Persist| IDB[IndexedDB]
    end
    
    Console -.->|Block| Dreamer
    Mic -.->|Block| Dreamer
```

**Key Components:**
- **Hardware Abstraction:** Clamps WebGPU buffers (256MB/1GB) for Snapdragon/Mobile stability.
- **Consciousness Semaphore:** Ensures `Dreamer` (background tasks) yields instantly to `Console` or `Mic` (active tasks) to prevent VRAM crashes.
- **Unified Logger:** Broadcasts logs to `log-viewer.html` via `BroadcastChannel`.

---

## 2. The Memory (CozoDB + WASM)
A Hybrid Graph-Vector database running entirely in WASM, persisted to IndexedDB/OPFS.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    MEMORY {
        string id PK
        int timestamp
        string role
        string content
        string source
        vector embedding
    }
    RELATIONSHIPS {
        string source_id FK
        string target_id FK
        string type
        float weight
    }
    MEMORY ||--o{ RELATIONSHIPS : connects_to
```

**Schema:**
- **`*memory`**: Stores raw text, chat logs, and vector embeddings (`<F32; 384>`).
- **`*relationships`**: Stores synaptic links generated by the Dreamer (Subconscious).
- **Persistence:** Writes to WASM memory, auto-flushes to `coda_memory` (IndexedDB).

---

## 3. The Logic (Graph-R1 Loop)
The reasoning engine combining Semantic Search (Vector) and Lexical Search (Keyword) with a self-correcting LLM loop.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Reflex: User Query
    Reflex --> ContextManager: Top-k Vectors + Keywords
    ContextManager --> LLM: Virtual Prompt
    LLM --> Synthesis: Answer Found
    LLM --> Reflex: NEED_CONTEXT (Tool Call)
    Synthesis --> [*]: Stream Response
```

**Flow:**
1. **Reflex:** Simultaneous Vector + Regex search.
2. **Context Manager:** Assembles "Virtual Prompt" with retrieved clues + System Time.
3. **Loop:** LLM generates answer or requests more data (`NEED_CONTEXT:`).

---

## 4. The Bridge (Silent Injection)
Extensions allow the Sovereign Brain to inject context into corporate LLMs (Gemini/ChatGPT).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Chrome as Chrome Extension
    participant Bridge as WebGPU Bridge (ws:8080)
    participant DB as CozoDB (WASM)
    
    Chrome->>Chrome: User types... (3s pause)
    Chrome->>Bridge: queryMemories(text)
    Bridge->>DB: Run Datalog Query
    DB-->>Bridge: JSON Result
    Bridge-->>Chrome: Context Summary
    Chrome->>Chrome: Inject into Textarea
```

**Security:**
- **Local-First:** No data leaves localhost.
- **Obfuscation:** Binds to random port or 8080.
- **Protocol:** WebSocket for low-latency (<50ms) lookup.

# Sovereign WASM Specification (Root Kernel)

## Architecture Overview
The **Root Coda** system runs entirely in the browser using a unified Kernel (`sovereign.js`) that manages Compute (WebLLM) and Memory (CozoDB).

## 1. The Kernel (`tools/modules/sovereign.js`)
The Kernel is the standard library for all Root Tools. It enforces consistency and safety.

### 1.1 Hardware Abstraction ("Snapdragon Fix")
**Problem**: Adreno GPUs (Snapdragon X Elite) and some mobile chips crash if a WebGPU buffer >256MB is requested, or if context exceeds 4k tokens without specific driver flags.
**Solution**: `getWebGPUConfig(profile)`
- **Lite**: Clamps buffer to 256MB, Context to 2048.
- **Mid**: Clamps buffer to 1GB, Context to 4096.
- **High/Ultra**: Unlocked.

### 1.2 Unified Logging
**Problem**: `console.log` is invisible on mobile or when running as a PWA.
**Solution**: `SovereignLogger`
- Broadcasts all logs to `BroadcastChannel('sovereign-logs')`.
- Consumed by `log-viewer.html` for real-time remote debugging.

### 1.3 Reactive State
**Problem**: Spaghetti code updating DOM elements manually.
**Solution**: `createStore(initialState)`
- Lightweight `Proxy`-based store.
- Components subscribe to changes: `subscribe((key, val) => updateUI(key, val))`.

## 2. Memory Layer (CozoDB WASM)
The Kernel provides a standardized loader: `initCozo(wasmPath)`.

### Data Portability
- **Lossless Export**: The Root Builder features a "Lossless Export" button.
- **Mechanism**: Dumps full Cozo relations (including vectors) to a JSON file.
- **Use Case**: Transfer full "Brain" state between devices or backup.

### Schema
```datalog
:create memory {
    id: String 
    => 
    timestamp: Int, 
    role: String, 
    content: String, 
    source: String, 
    embedding: <F32; 384> 
}
```

## 3. Tool Bridge (Legacy Support)
The `webgpu_bridge.py` acts as a secure relay (websocket <-> http) for external tools (like VS Code extensions) to access the Browser's LLM.
- **Input**: HTTP/REST (`/v1/chat/completions`)
- **Output**: WebSocket (`ws://localhost:8080/ws/chat`)

### 3.1 Local Model Serving (Storage Quota Bypass)
**Problem**: Browsers (especially in Incognito/Guest modes) strictly limit persistent storage (e.g., <300MB), preventing the caching of large LLM weights (~2GB+).
**Solution**: The Bridge acts as a local HTTP File Server.
- **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8080/models/{model_id}/...`
- **Mechanism**: 
    1. Frontend requests model from localhost.
    2. If 404, Frontend triggers `POST /v1/models/pull`.
    3. Bridge downloads artifacts from Hugging Face to `./models`.
    4. Frontend polls status and loads the model into RAM (bypassing IndexedDB quota).

## 4. Audio Input (Root Mic)
**Goal**: Pure client-side speech-to-text without sending audio to a cloud.

### 4.1 Pipeline
1. **Capture**: `MediaRecorder` (WebM) -> 48kHz decoding.
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Downsampling to 16kHz (Whisper Native).
   - **Noise Gate**: Discards audio if peak amplitude < 0.01 (Prevents transcribing silence).
   - **Amplification**: Smart gain (max 5x) for quiet voices, but capped to avoid boosting noise floor.
3. **Inference (WASM)**: 
   - Model: `Xenova/whisper-tiny.en` (Quantized).
   - **Long-form Strategy**: Uses `chunk_length_s: 30` and `stride_length_s: 5` to process audio exceeding the model's native 30s window.
4. **Post-Processing (Refinement)**:
   - **Hallucination Filter**: Regex removal of common Whisper artifacts (e.g., "[Music]", "Applause", "Amara.org").
   - **LLM Cleanup**: The raw transcript is passed to the local Qwen2.5 instance with a system prompt to fix grammar/punctuation without altering meaning.

### 4.2 Summarization Loop
- **Trigger**: User clicks "Summarize & Clarify" after a successful transcription.
- **Process**: The cleaned transcript is sent back to the Local Kernel (Qwen2.5) with a prompt to "summarize and clarify core meaning."
- **Output**: The transcript is replaced by the summary, which is automatically copied to the clipboard.

## 5. Parallel Compute (The Worker)
To prevent UI freezing during heavy inference, the LLM runs in a dedicated Web Worker.

### 5.1 `tools/modules/llm-worker.js`
- **Role**: Hosts the `MLCEngine` instance.
- **Communication**: Uses `WebWorkerMLCEngineHandler` to bridge messages between the main thread and the worker.
- **Benefit**: Ensures the UI remains responsive (scrolling, typing) even while the GPU is crunching tokens.

## 6. Resource Management (Orchestrator)
**Problem**: Multiple browser tabs (Mic, Console, Dreamer) competing for the single GPU resource led to deadlocks, timeouts, and "Device Lost" errors.
**Solution**: A Priority-Queue based Locking System with enhanced timeout handling and emergency procedures.

### 6.1 GPU Controller (`tools/modules/sovereign.js`)
- **Serialized Loading**: `withModelLoadLock()` ensures only one tab loads a model at a time, preventing GPU overload during initial loading.
- **Access Priority**:
  - **Priority 0 (High)**: Root Mic (Voice Input - cannot wait)
  - **Priority 10 (Med)**: Root Console (Chat - user waiting)
  - **Priority 15 (Med)**: Default priority
  - **Priority 20 (Low)**: Root Dreamer (Background tasks)
- **Timeouts**: Increased broken-lock timeout from 60s to **120s** (2 minutes) to accommodate large model loading.
- **Retry Logic**: Added retry mechanism with proper error handling.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Direct WebGPU access when bridge unavailable.
- **Status Checking**: Added GPU status check functionality.
- **Emergency Release**: If a lock is held >120s, it is forcibly broken to prevent system deadlock.

### 6.2 Bridge Orchestration (`smart_gpu_bridge.py`)
- **Queue Tracking**: Tracks request start times to prevent starvation.
- **Enhanced Timeouts**: Increased timeout from 60s to 120s for lock acquisition.
- **Request Tracking**: Added request_start_times to prevent queue starvation.
- **Enhanced Status**: Detailed queue information in status endpoint.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /v1/gpu/status`: Monitor active locks and queue depth.
  - `POST /v1/gpu/lock`: Acquire lock (blocking).
  - `POST /v1/gpu/unlock`: Release GPU lock.
  - `POST /v1/gpu/reset`: Standard reset.
  - `POST /v1/gpu/force-release-all`: Nuclear option for stuck states.
  - `POST /v1/gpu/force-release`: Emergency release endpoint.
  - `POST /v1/hot-reload`: Hot reload endpoint for development.

### 6.3 GPU Management Utilities
- **GPU Manager Script** (`scripts/gpu_manager.py`): Command-line tool to monitor and manage GPU resources.
- **Test Script** (`scripts/test_gpu_fixes.py`): Comprehensive testing of GPU resource management.
- **Monitoring Commands**:
  - `python scripts/gpu_manager.py --status`: Check GPU status
  - `python scripts/gpu_manager.py --monitor --interval 10`: Monitor continuously
  - `python scripts/gpu_manager.py --force-release`: Force release GPU locks
  - `python scripts/gpu_manager.py --reset`: Standard reset
  - `python scripts/gpu_manager.py --hot-reload`: Trigger hot reload

## 7. Development Infrastructure
**Problem**: Restarting the Python bridge and refreshing 3 browser tabs for every small code change is slow.

### 7.1 Hot Reload System
- **Backend**: `smart_gpu_bridge.py` monitors its own source code (and `download_models.py`) for changes. It automatically reloads the Python process while preserving active WebSocket connections if possible.
- **Frontend**: `gpu-hot-reloader.js` connects to the bridge via WebSocket. When the bridge signals a reload (or detects an HTML update), the browser auto-refreshes.
- **Safety**: Automatically releases all GPU locks during a reload event to prevent "Ghost Locks".

# Tools Changelog

## [Unreleased] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- **On-Demand Model Serving**: `model-server-chat.html` now checks `http://localhost:8080/models/{id}` before loading. If missing, it triggers a download via the Bridge.
- **Quota Bypass**: Using `useIndexedDBCache: false` for large models to bypass browser storage limits, relying on the Bridge's local file server instead.

### Fixed
- **Model ID Mismatch**: Fixed logic in `loadModel` where the `mlc-ai/` prefix was being aggressively stripped, causing config lookups to fail.
- **UI Progress**: Added real-time progress bars for server-side model downloads.

 - 2025-12-23

### Added
- **Orchestrator Model:** New `orchestrator.py` tool to programmatically interact with the MLC Bridge from Python.
- **Health Endpoint:** Added `/health` to `webgpu_bridge.py` for extension connectivity checks.
- **Audit Whitelist:** Added `/audit/server-logs` to auth whitelist in Bridge to fix Log Viewer 401 errors.

### Changed
- **Bridge Port:** Moved standard bridge port from `8000` to `8080` to avoid conflicts with `http.server`.
- **Launch Scripts:** Updated `start-sovereign-console.bat` and `launch-chromium-d3d12.bat` to respect new port `8080` and correct paths.
- **Root Dreamer:**
  - Robustified `init()` to handle non-Error objects during crash.
  - Improved JSON parsing to strip markdown code blocks before parsing.
  - Added strict engine readiness check to `dreamLoop` to prevent race conditions.
- **Root Console:**
  - Added "High Performance (Small)" models (Qwen 2.5 1.5B, TinyLlama) to the dropdown.
  - Updated JS mapper to handle new small model paths.
  - Fixed crash in `executeR1Loop` where `genErr.message` could be undefined.

### Fixed
- **WebGPU Crash:** Mitigated `DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED` by advising single-tab usage and providing smaller model options for constrained profiles.
- **Extension Connection:** Fixed CORS and Port mismatch preventing the Chrome Extension from connecting to the Bridge.
