# ECE Specification Documents

This directory contains essential specification documents for the External Context Engine (ECE) project.

The following documents are included:

- **`spec.md`**: The core architecture, vision, and LLM configuration for the ECE.
- **`plan.md`**: The high-level development plan and roadmap.
- **`tasks.md`**: A list of development tasks.
- **`reasoning_flow.md`**: Details of the Markovian reasoning flow implementation, including the current EnhancedOrchestratorAgent processing flow.

## Current Development Status

The ECE has successfully implemented the major architectural features and has now transitioned to validation, refinement, and continuous evolution. The current focus includes:

1. **System Validation & GUI Testing**: Rigorous end-to-end testing of the complete system
2. **UTCP Implementation**: Full alignment with official UTCP 1.0+ specification using decentralized tool discovery
3. **EnhancedOrchestratorAgent Implementation**: Development and refinement of the EnhancedOrchestratorAgent with improved context management, parallel thinking, and Markovian reasoning capabilities
4. **Markovian Thinking Integration**: Implementation of the Markovian Thinking paradigm based on the "Delethink" research for extremely long and complete reasoning with linear compute scaling
5. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Implementation of enhanced coordination between agents based on research from "Emergent Coordination in Multi-Agent Language Models", including thinker personas, Theory of Mind (ToM) integration, and coordination analysis metrics
6. **Continuous Improvement & Co-Evolution**: Ongoing enhancement and evolution of the system
