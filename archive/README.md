# Global Archive - Context-Engine

This folder contains archived components of the repository kept for historical, reference, or migration purposes. These artifacts may include:
- Deprecated scripts, previous storage migrations, legacy test suites, or legacy protocol implementations (MCP) used in prior versions.

Important subfolders:
- `removed_tool_protocols/` — historical tool protocol implementations (MCP/UTCP) archived for reference. These are not part of the active runtime and should not be used as primary code paths.
- `db/` — previously used database artifacts and migration helpers.
- `docs_removed/` — archival documentation not currently part of `specs/`.

Guidance:
- Do not execute scripts from this folder on production databases without creating a backup and testing in a clean staging environment.
- If code under `archive/` needs to be resurrected for compatibility or investigation, copy it to an `icebox/` folder and work from there; do not reintroduce legacy code into `src` without review.

If you're unsure why something is present, file an issue for a maintainer to review before running or deleting archived assets.

## Legacy SQLite Files

Some archived scripts in `ece-core/archive/` and elsewhere still reference SQLite and `aiosqlite`.
These files are intentionally preserved as a migration aid and for traceability. If you need to re-run
any of these scripts for migration or research, follow these steps:

1. Create a backup of any production artifacts (e.g., `ece_memory.db`, Neo4j exports).
2. Create and use an isolated Python virtual environment and install `aiosqlite` if needed.
3. Set `ECE_ALLOW_LEGACY_SQLITE=1` in your environment to explicitly allow legacy usage.
4. Run the script in a staging environment and follow the migration or extraction steps documented in the script's header or the `ece-core/archive/legacy_sqlite/README.md`.

If you have any doubt, ask a repo maintainer or open an issue before running archived scripts.
